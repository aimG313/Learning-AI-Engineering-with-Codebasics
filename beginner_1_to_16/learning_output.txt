1)variable = container = to store some specific data
these are call variables because the value can vary

naming convention: can't use something which is already included in python as a keyword

2)Number operation:
% = modular operator = gives remainder 
** = power operator

3)Print operator: print()

to round off to certain digit: print(round(,))

4)String: sequence of character
to access use => string[]
in python string members can't be varry
to traverse use => string[:]
to use multiline use => ''' '''
to concatinate => string1 + string2

4)type casting: type conversion in python
eg:string(Number), int(a)

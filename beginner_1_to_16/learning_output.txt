1)variable = container = to store some specific data
these are call variables because the value can vary

naming convention: can't use something which is already included in python as a keyword

2)Number operation:
% = modular operator = gives remainder 
** = power operator

3)Print operator: print()

to round off to certain digit: print(round(,))

4)String: sequence of character
to access use => string[]
in python string members can't be varry
to traverse use => string[:]
to use multiline use => ''' '''
to concatinate => string1 + string2

4)type casting: type conversion in python
eg:string(Number), int(a)

5)list: similar to array in C++ 

to access a item from list use=> list[index]
to traverse like string use=> list[:]
to add element at last => list.append("item")
to insert element in specific location=> 
list.insert(1,"item")
to concatinate = list1 + list2
to get the length of list = print(len(list))
to test some item whether present or not => "item" in list

6)Input: use input("")
in python input operation always takes input a string
use typecasting for data type change

7)loop:

for i in list:
  operation

range of loop=> range(start,end)
to stop the loop before completing use => break
to skip a operation use=> continue
